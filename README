Upload the nft images to nft marketplace via IPFS 
Uploading NFT (Non-Fungible Token) images to an NFT marketplace using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a crucial step in the process of minting and selling digital collectibles. IPFS, a decentralized and distributed file storage system, ensures the permanence and availability of these images. By utilizing IPFS, NFT creators can store their digital assets in a resilient and censorship-resistant manner. This method enhances the security and reliability of the NFT marketplace, as it links each token to an immutable and verifiable representation of the associated image, fostering trust among buyers and collectors in the blockchain-based ecosystem.
